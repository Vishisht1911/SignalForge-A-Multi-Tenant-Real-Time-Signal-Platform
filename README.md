# SignalForge-A-Multi-Tenant-Real-Time-Signal-Platform
Built a multi-tenant signal processing platform on PostgreSQL with strict tenant isolation using tenant_id. Designed time-series schemas for OHLCV data, immutable trading signals with JSONB metadata, and async job tracking. Optimized with composite indexes to scale reliably to millions of records per day.
